# ToDoRo
A minimalist to-do list website to keep track of your day-to-day tasks.

## Tech stack used
This project relies heavily on node.js and ejs.   
CSS is used for styling.  
The UI design was inspired from templates on [dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/).

## Features intended to be implemented in the future versions
### A pomodoro timer
The name of the website 'ToDoRo' was decided so as to incorporate a to-do list + [pomodoro](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique). However, the application would break everytime I tried to set a 25 minute timer.
### Deploying the website on a hosting service
To truly bring the website to life, it is intended to deploy it on a hosting platform. The initial idea was to deploy it on heroku but unfortunately heroku failed two months back and the idea was disbanded. 
### Alert messages for empty inputs
Currently, submitting an empty fill-in does not notify the user to 'Enter a valid task.' This is because alert is a window object method which cannot be used in server-side rendering. 


I would gladly accept any suggestions or help on this project.
Thank You:)
